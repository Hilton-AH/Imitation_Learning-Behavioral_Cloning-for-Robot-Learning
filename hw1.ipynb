        "Welcome to your first official coding Assignment of 4756. In this short notebook, we are going to train agents to play the LunarLander game from OpenAI Gym, using data provided by an expert agent. Specifically, you will gain exposure to implementing behavioral cloning (BC) and dataset aggregation (DAgger) methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evaluation:**\n",
        "Your code will be tested for correctness, and for certain assignments, speed. Please remember that all assignments should be completed individually.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Academic Integrity:** We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else’s code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don’t try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don’t let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.\n",

        "**Getting Help:** The [#resources](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4756/2023sp/#resources) section on the course website is your friend (especially for this first assignment)! If you ever feel stuck in these projects, please feel free to avail yourself to office hours and Edstem! If you are unable to make any of the office hours listed, please let TAs know and we will be happy to assist. Since this is the first iteration of this course, please do not hesitate to reach out to TAs if you find any errors in the assignments. "
